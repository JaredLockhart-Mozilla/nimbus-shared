# Nimbus Docs

Docs should be stored here.

## Writing docs

Edit pages in the `pages` directory. Most docs should be written in `.mdx` format, which is similar
to standard Markdown, except JSX-style HTML elements can be imported and used as well.

The base layout and site navigation are defined in `pages/_app.js`. If you add a new page make sure
to add it to the navigation in that file. Styles are defined in `global_style.css`.
