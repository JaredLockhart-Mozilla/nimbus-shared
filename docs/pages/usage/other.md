# Usage from other environments

For environment besides Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, consider using the npm package and
loading the schemas directly from the filesystem. After installing this package via `npm`, the
schemas will be available at `node_modules/@mozilla/nimbus-shared/schemas/<group>/<type>.json`.

If this is needed, please [file an issue](https://github.com/mozilla/nimbus-shared/issues/new) and
let us know about your use case.
