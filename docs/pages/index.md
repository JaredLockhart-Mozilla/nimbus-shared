# Nimbus Shared

This is a place to define data and schemas used across Project Nimbus.

Any data that moves between systems should have TypeScript types defined here, which will be
automatically converted to JSON Schema. Any data that needs to be re-used by multiple systems should
be stored here to be shared.

Nimbus Shared can be used via a [PyPI package](./python) in Python, an [NPM package](./js-and-ts) in
JavaScript or TypeScript, and [directly](./direct-use) if neither of the packaged options work.
