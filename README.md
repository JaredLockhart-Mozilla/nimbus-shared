# Rapid Experiments Shared ![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/mozilla/rapid-experiments-shared)

This is a place to define data and schemas used across the rapid experiments
program.

Any data that moves between systems should have a schema defined here. Schemas
are defined using Typescript, and automatically converted to JSON Schema. Any
data that needs to be re-used by multiple systems should be stored here to be
shared.

## Working on this repo

Common tasks are defined as Yarn scripts.

```shell
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
```

## Using the schemas

## Adding a new schema
